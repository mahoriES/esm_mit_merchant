# eSamudaay - Merchant app (Foore)

## Important Note:

We at eSamudaay are currently using Flutter verison **1.22.1** which is behind the latest stable release(Flutter has migrated to Null Safety) due to some stability and compatibility issues. Hence you will not be able to run the app if on latest Flutter release. Hence we strongly recommend downgrading to the version we use.

>Note: We are working on migrating our projects to Null Safety and then this workaround won't be required

Please use the following command for resolving this issue

``` flutter downgrade v1.22.1 ``` 

After this, run any Flutter command (such as `flutter doctor`), and Flutter will take care of downloading/compiling everything required to run this version.


## Code usage Guidelines
